Game of Life reversed

Milestone 1: done<br>
UI and basic game seems to be working.<br><br>

Milestone 2: done<br>
Brute force reversing seems to be working on simple cases.<br>
It is slow, but steady. Also, not worlds best/fastest implementation, merely a proof of concept.<br><br>

Milestone 3: done<br>
More sophisticated reversing algorithm seems to be working. It is not a Hardouin-Drupac's method, but merely a concurrent brute force parallelized over all processor cores found in the machine if the grid size is bigger than 4x4.

Navigate using arrow keys:<br>
